New software for analysing count data in the transformation models framework is
now available from  [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cotram){:target="_blank"}.

The R add-on package **cotram** is specifically designed for fitting and evaluating
count transformation models, featuring a diverse set of flexible count models.

To get started, install and load the package using R

```r
install.packages("cotram")

library("cotram")
```

For a detailed illustration of the different models and methods available in
the **cotram** package, refer to the package vignette. It provides a
step-by-step analysis of a count data example:

```r
vignette("cotram", package = "cotram")
```
