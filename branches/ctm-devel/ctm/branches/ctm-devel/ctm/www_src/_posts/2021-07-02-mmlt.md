[New paper](https://doi.org/10.1111/sjos.12501){:target="_blank"} introduces
novel multivariate conditional transformation models, where the marginal
distributions can be understood as univariate transformation models.  The
joint distribution is characterised by a Gaussian copula, which also allows
covariate-dependent correlations to be modelled.

Some forms of these models can be estimated by the `mmlt()` function in
package
[**tram**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tram){:target="_blank"}.
