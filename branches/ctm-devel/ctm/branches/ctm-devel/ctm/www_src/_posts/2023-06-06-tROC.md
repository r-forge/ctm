[New paper](https://doi.org/10.1177/09622802231176030){:target="_blank"}
online presenting a unified approach for evaluating diagnostic tests with
covariate adjustment using transformation models. This approach
allows to estimate receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curves and summary indices while handling the complexities
associated with medical data, including non-normal data, covariates that
influence the diagnostic potential of a test, ordinal biomarkers, or
censored data due to instrument detection limits.

Transformation ROC analysis can be performed using the
[**tram**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tram){:target="_blank"}
package in R.
