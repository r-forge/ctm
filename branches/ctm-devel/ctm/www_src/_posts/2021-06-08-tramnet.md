New software for estimating regularized transformation models is now available from  
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tramnet){:target="_blank"}.

The R add-on package **tramnet** allows you to fit regularized regression
models with elastic net penalties for various types of responses and censoring.

Get started by installing and loading the package from within R
```r
install.packages("tramnet")

library("tramnet")
```

Explore the accompanying vignette
```r
vignette("tramnet", package = "tramnet")
```
which takes you through the inner workings of **tramnet** and an 
exemplary data analysis.
