[New paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxac048){:target="_blank"}
introduces marginally interpretable transformation models for clustered
observations.  The marginal distributions are described by a linear
transformation model and the correlations by a joint multivariate normal
distribution.  These models can handle skewed, bounded, and survival
continuous outcomes, as well as binary and ordered categorical responses.

The models can be estimated in R using the `mtram()` function in the
[**tram**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tram){:target="_blank"}
package.

The following code can be run to see applications of these models in R:

```r
demo("mtram", package = "tram")
vignette("mtram", package = "tram")
```
