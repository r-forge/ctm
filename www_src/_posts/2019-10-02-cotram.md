New software for analysing count data in the transformation models framework available from  [CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cotram).

The R add-on package **cotram** is specifically designed for fitting and evaluating transformation models for count data.

Get started by installing and loading the package from within R

```r
install.packages("cotram")

library("cotram")
```

 The package featues a diverse set of models and is accompanied by a vignette including a step-by-step tutorial of an analysis of a count data set.
