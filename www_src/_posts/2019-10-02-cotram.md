New software for analysing count data in the transformation models framework is now available from  [CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cotram).

The R add-on package **cotram** is specifically designed for fitting and evaluating count transformation models and
features a diverse set of models.

Get started by installing and loading the package from within R

```r
install.packages("cotram")

library("cotram")
```

Have look at the package vignette for a detailed illustration of the different models and methods of the **cotram** package by a simple step-by-step analysis of a count data example.


```r
vignette("cotram", package = "cotram")
```
