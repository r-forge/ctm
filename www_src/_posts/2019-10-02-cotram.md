New software for analysing count data in the transformation models framework is
now available from  [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cotram){:target="_blank"}.

The R add-on package **cotram** is specifically designed for fitting and evaluating
count transformation models and features a diverse set of models.

Get started by installing and loading the package from within R

```r
install.packages("cotram")

library("cotram")
```

Have a look at the package vignette for a detailed illustration of the different
models and methods of the **cotram** package by a simple step-by-step analysis of
a count data example.

```r
vignette("cotram", package = "cotram")
```
