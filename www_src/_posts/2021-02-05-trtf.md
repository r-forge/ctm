[New paper](https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2021.1872581){:target="_blank"} 
discussing a novel transformation tree algorithm leading to transformation
forests, which allow to compute fully parametric yet very general predictive
distributions. 

An open-source implementation of transformation trees and transformation
forests is available in the R add-on package [trtf](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=trtf){:target="_blank"}.
