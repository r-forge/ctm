[New paper](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2023.2203177){:target="_blank"}
online introducing location-scale transformation models.  These models
allow for the estimation of covariate-dependent dispersion within the
transformation model framework, providing a versatile approach to regression
modeling for various outcomes.

The models can be estimated using the
[**tram**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tram){:target="_blank"}
package in R.  By running the demo, you can explore the application of
location-scale transformation models for crossing or partially proportional
hazards, stratified models, and other analyses in R:

```r
demo("stram", package = "tram")
```
