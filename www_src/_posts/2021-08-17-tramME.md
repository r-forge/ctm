A new R package for fitting mixed-effects transformation models to grouped
data is now available from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tramME){:target="_blank"}.

The package **tramME** provides formula-based specification and estimation
of mixed-effects regression models for various types of outcomes with
possible random censoring.

To get started, install and load the package using R

```r
install.packages("tramME")

library("tramME")
```

The accompanying vignette provides technical details about the model setup as
well as several worked-out examples:

```r
vignette("tramME", package = "tramME")
```

Technical details are given in 
[doi:10.32614/RJ-2021-075](https://doi.org/10.32614/RJ-2021-075){:target="_blank"}.

An application to individual participant data meta-analysis is shown in 
[doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxab045](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxab045){:target="_blank"}.
