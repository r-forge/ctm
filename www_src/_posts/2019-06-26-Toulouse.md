Slides and R code for the 
[pre-conference tutorial on transformation models](http://www.user2019.fr/tutorials/) (afternoon session on Tuesday,
2019-07-09) at [useR!  2019](http://www.user2019.fr) in Toulouse, France, is
now available.

The zip archive [useR2019_transformation_models.zip]({{ site.urldoc }}useR2019_transformation_models.zip)
contains a PDF file with slides (4up in case you want to bring a hard copy)
as well as an R transcript file for reproducing all results. Some models
take a little longer to fit (roughly 10mins on my computer). You don't need
to run the code, but please make sure to install the current CRAN 
versions of the necessary packages (listed at the beginning of this file).
