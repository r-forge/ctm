Are you sick of cookbook-style statistics?  Then treat yourself with
transformation models.  Understand many classical, contemporary, and novel
statistical models and their connections in a compact yet simple theoretical
framework.  Build novel models tailored to your own research question.  Make
things work your way by putting together flexible software components in
[the R system](https://www.R-project.org).
