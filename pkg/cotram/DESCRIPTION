Description: Count transformation models featuring 
        parameters interpretable as discrete hazard ratios, odds ratios,
        reverse-time discrete hazard ratios, or transformed expectations. 
        An appropriate data transformation for a count outcome and
        regression coefficients are simultaneously estimated by maximising
        the exact discrete log-likelihood using the computational framework
        provided in package 'mlt', technical details are given in
        Siegfried & Hothorn (2020) <DOI:10.1111/2041-210X.13383>. 
        The package also contains an experimental implementation of 
        multivariate count transformation models with an application
        to multi-species distribution models <DOI:10.48550/arXiv.2201.13095>.
