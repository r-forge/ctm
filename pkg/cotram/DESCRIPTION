Description: Count transformation models featuring 
        parameters interpretable as discrete hazard ratios, odds ratios,
        reverse-time discrete hazard ratios, or transformed expectations. 
        An appropriate data transformation for a count outcome and
        regression coefficients are simultaneously estimated by maximising
        the exact discrete log-likelihood using the computational framework
        provided in package 'mlt', technical details are given in
        Siegfried & Hothorn (2020) <DOI:10.1111/2041-210X.13383>.
