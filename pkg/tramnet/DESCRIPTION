Description: Partially penalized versions of specific transformation models
    implemented in package 'mlt'. Available models include a fully parametric version
    of the Cox model, other parametric survival models (Weibull, etc.), models for
    binary and ordered categorical variables, normal and transformed-normal (Box-Cox type)
    linear models, and continuous outcome logistic regression. Hyperparameter tuning
    is facilitated through model-based optimization functionalities from package 'mlr3MBO'.
    The methodology is described in Kook et al. (2021) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2021-054>.
    Transformation models and model-based optimization are described in
    Hothorn et al. (2019) <doi:10.1111/sjos.12291> and
    Bischl et al. (2016) <arxiv:1703.03373>, respectively.
