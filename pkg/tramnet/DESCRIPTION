Description: Partially penalised versions of specific transformation models
  implemented in package 'mlt'. Available models include Cox models, some parametric

  normal and non-normal (Box-Cox type) linear models, and continuous outcome logistic regression.
Depends: R (>= 3.6.0), tram (>= 0.3-1), CVXR (>= 0.99-4), mlrMBO (>= 1.1-2)
