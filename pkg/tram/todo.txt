## Features

- implementation of perm_test for class "stram"

- move mmlt to mlt
- implement tram::Mmlt with sequential, mixed variables etc
  maybe we can omit domargins = FALSE and just used "fixed" on the marginal
  parameters?
- interface Compris to Mmlt

## Checks / Fixes

- problems with confband() when log_first = TRUE 

library("tram")

load(system.file("rda", "Primary_endpoint_data.rda", package = "TH.data"))

levs <- levels(CAOsurv$randarm)
nd1 <- data.frame(randarm = factor(levs, levels = levs))

mc <- Coxph(iDFS ~ randarm, data = CAOsurv, log_first = TRUE)

try(cb <- confband(as.mlt(mc), newdata =  nd1[1,, drop = FALSE], K = 20, cheat = 100))



- tram only works for integer y if all consecutive integers are present in the data:

library("tram")

## works if all sequential integers are present
y <- as.integer(rpois(100, 2))
Lm(y ~ 1)

## doesn't work anymore if we remove all integers == 2
yi <- y[y != 2]
try(Lm(yi ~ 1))

### Problem with the support? Support excludes "2" in above model,
### which causes problem for the interval [2, 3]?
s <- min(yi):max(yi)
Lm(yi ~ 1, support = s)



- Interval for integers is defined as (y-1, 1], maybe change to [y-1, y]?
