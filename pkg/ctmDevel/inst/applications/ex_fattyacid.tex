\caption{Evolution Canyon Bacteria. Estimated conditional distribution functions
         (depicted as $pI(p < 0.5) + (1-p)I(p > 0.5)$ for probability $p$)
         of the fatty acid content of bacteria from six different putative (PE)
         ecotypes. Model (\ref{fattyacid_lin}) was fitted
         with (``linear'') and without (``linear $M = \infty$'') early stopping via the bootstrap
         whereas model (\ref{fattyacid_flex}), here denoted ``smooth'', 
         was stopped early. The observations are given as rugs. \label{fattyacid-plot}}
